# Theme color customization.
# All options below this line of the configuration use the Sequence system.

# Sequences work either one of three ways.
# Sequences can take one of [6] subkey true/false options (seen below).
# Sequences can take a more advanced form using chat color codes. (&a, &b&l, &c&l&o etc)
# Sequences can also use both if you're into that sort of thing.
# Sequences are being used as examples in all ways below.

# You can also use emojis, though only few are compatible.
# Here is an example for a pink heart: "&d[HEART]"
# You can setup additional emojis in the theme config.yml

tags:
  
  # You can add and remove tags for customization.
  # You can name tags what ever you want, and use whatever you want between the "<>" syntax.
  # AOE: lang.yml files, partition.yml "Motd" section, ranks/config.yml file.
