  # It may look a little overwhelming at first, but this file is designed to be as simple as possible.
  # You can find and customize each <Tag> in each themes theme.yml file.
  
  # Each node is pretty self explanatory (except for '*', this means all sub nodes).
  # But if you're still having trouble, just leave this file as is. Some help has been left below.
  # Again, if you can't be bothered, the messages are already done pretty well. Remember not all
  # nodes use the variables by default, as %display% and %command% suggests. So go wild with it!
