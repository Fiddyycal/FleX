# Theme color customization.
# All options below this line of the configuration use the Sequence system.

# Sequences work either one of three ways.
# Sequences can take one of [6] subkey true/false options (seen below).
# Sequences can take a more advanced form using chat color codes.
# Sequences can also use both if you're into that sort of thing.
# Sequences are being used as examples in all ways below.

# ChatColor unique names and their minecraft color codes:
